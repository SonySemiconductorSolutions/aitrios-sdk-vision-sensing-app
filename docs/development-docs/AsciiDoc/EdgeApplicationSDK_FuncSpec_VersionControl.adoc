|Terms/Abbreviations |Meaning 

|GitHub
|Software version control platform

|===

== Reference materials

* Reference/Related documents
** GitHub Document
*** https://docs.github.com/ja

== Expected use case
* Version Jupyter Notebooks for downloading datasets
* Version Jupyter Notebooks for AI model quantization
* Version post-processing source code


== Functional overview
=== Functional overview
* The SDK is provided to users as a GitHub repository
* Users fork (or clone) the SDK repository from GitHub for development
* Users use GitHub features for version control


== User interface specifications
=== Prerequisite
* Have a GitHub account

=== How to start each function
* Access the SDK's repository on GitHub to fork or clone the SDK's repository to user's environment
* Proceed with development according to team or project operating rules


== FYI: Examples of versioning operations
* The following is an example of how to operate version control
* Follow team or project operating rules, if any

* About the SDK directory structure:
** This SDK has a separate directory for each feature type as follows
** Features are independent of each other and can be independently versioned

.Files edited by the user (version control targets)
|===
|Feature type |Control target |Description |Possible fix |Purpose of version control (example)

|prepare dataset
|Notebooks, configuration files
|Jupyter Notebooks to download image data for learning
|Edit various settings according to your purpose. (Image category, number of images acquired, etc.)
|Record the parameters and settings specified at the time of image download,  +
so that you can refer to them when you want to reproduce your learning 
with the same image data. 

|prepare model
|Notebooks for learning, quantization, configuration files
|Jupyter Notebooks for learning and quantizing your own AI models
|Edit various settings according to your purpose.
|Record parameters and other information used to learn and quantize the model,  +
so that you can refer to them when you want to reproduce the learning with the same parameters.

|prepare application
|A set of post-processing sources, Makefile
|Source code describing AI model post-processing,  + 
and build files to compile to Wasm format
|Develop post-processing logic.
|Improve development efficiency by keeping a history of updates. +
It also makes it easier for teams to develop.

|===

* Branch
** By creating a branch, multiple feature development can proceed simultaneously
** It can also be independently versioned + 
by editing the prepare dataset, prepare model and prepare application in separate branches
*** Branch operation example:
+
[source, sh]
----
main
	│-- feature/prepare_application/object_detection_xxx (1)
	│-- feature/prepare_application/image_classification_xxx (2)
	│-- feature/prepare_model/xxx (3)
	│-- feature/prepare_dataset/xxx (4)
	│-- bugfix/XXX (5)
----
(1) Feature development branch for object detection model +
(2) Feature development branch for image classification model +
(3) AI model creation management branch +
(4) Dataset download management branch +
(5) Bug fix branch

* Commit history
** Commit changes to a file when you want to save them, so you can refer to them later as a revision history
*** Operating example:
**** Save notebook runtime information
. Commit to the Git branch with notebooks edited
***** You can reference the settings from your commit history + 
if you want to rerun your notebook with the same parameter settings as in the past

. In addition, by tying information from the data used for input to the commit, you can reproduce the notebook execution under identical conditions (input data, parameters)
***** It's up to the user how to tie input data to a commit, but an example is to write it as a commit message
****** Sample commit message (for quantize model):
+
[source, sh]
----
Quantization test
	description: xxxxxx
	input model: <url_to_model_resistry>
	dataset: <url_to_dataset_resistry>
	....

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Committer: XXXXXX
#
# On branch feature/quantize/xxx
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   xxxx.ipynb
----

* Tag
** Tagging commits makes it easier to access the version you need
*** Tagging with Git commands:
+
[source, sh]
....
git tag -a [tag name] -m 'tag comment' [commit id]
....
