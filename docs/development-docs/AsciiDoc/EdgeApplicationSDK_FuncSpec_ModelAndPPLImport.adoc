|Initial draft.

|2023/05/26
|Fixed the notation of tool names and parentheses. + 
Changed the default value of `**network_type**`. + 
Some environments do not render AsciiDoc's Mermaid diagrams, so modified to rendered image references. + 
Added alternate text to images.

** Users can do the following through the "**Console Access Library**":

*** Import AI models into "**Console for AITRIOS**"

**** Use AI models supported by "**Console for AITRIOS**". See https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/system-overview/[here].

**** Must store AI models to Azure Blob Storage to import into "**Console for AITRIOS**"

*** Convert AI models imported into "**Console for AITRIOS**"

*** Import "**PPL**" into "**Console for AITRIOS**"

**** Import the following "**PPL**":

***** SDK supports ".wasm" (File not yet AOT compiled)

*** Runs the API to check AI model import results

**** If the AI model information is successfully gotten, `**import_to_console.ipynb**` displays a successful message and the gotten status

*** Runs the API to convert AI model

**** If the API execution is successful, `**import_to_console.ipynb**` displays a successful message

**** It takes several tens of minutes to complete conversion of the AI model, so checks AI model conversion state

*** Runs the API to check AI model conversion state

**** If the conversion status of the AI model information is successfully gotten, `**import_to_console.ipynb**` displays a successful message and the gotten status

== User interface specifications (Delete "**PPL**")
=== Prerequisite
* You have registered as a user through "**Portal for AITRIOS**" and participated in the AITRIOS project

* You have imported "**PPL**" into "**Console for AITRIOS**"


=== How to start each function
. Launch the SDK environment and preview the `**README.md**` in the top directory
. Jump to the `**README.md**` in the `**tutorials**` directory from the hyperlink in the SDK environment top directory
. Jump to the `**4_prepare_application**` directory from the hyperlink in the `**README.md**` in the `**tutorials**` directory
. Jump to the `**README.md**` in the `**delete_application_on_console**` directory from the hyperlink in the `**README.md**` in the `**4_prepare_application**` directory
. Jump to each feature from each file in the `**delete_application_on_console**` directory


=== Run the notebook for system client authentication
. Jump to the `**README.md**` in the `**set_up_console_client**` directory from the hyperlink in the `**README.md**` in the `**delete_application_on_console**` directory
. Open the notebook for system client authentication, _*.ipynb_, in the `**set_up_console_client**` directory, and run the python scripts in it


=== Run the notebook to get "**PPL**" list
. Jump to the `**README.md**` in the `**get_application_list**` directory from the hyperlink in the `**README.md**` in the `**delete_application_on_console**` directory
. Open the notebook to get "**PPL**" list, _*.ipynb_, in the `**get_application_list**` directory, and run the python scripts in it


=== Create and edit the configuration file for running the notebook to delete "**PPL**"
NOTE: All parameters are required, unless otherwise indicated.

NOTE: The parameters passed to the "**Console Access Library**" API are as specified in the <<anchor-ref, "**Console Access Library**" API>>.

. Create and edit the configuration file, `**configuration.json**`, in the execution directory.

=== Run the notebook to delete "**PPL**"
. Open the notebook, `**delete_application_on_console.ipynb**`, in the `**delete_application_on_console**` directory, and run the python scripts in it

** The scripts do the following:

*** Checks that <<anchor-conf-ppl-del, _configuration.json_>> exists in the `**delete_application_on_console**` directory

**** If an error occurs, the error description is displayed and running is interrupted.

*** Checks the contents of <<anchor-conf-ppl-del, _configuration.json_>>

**** If an error occurs, the error description is displayed and running is interrupted.

*** Runs the API to delete "**PPL**"

**** If the deletion is successful, `**delete_application_on_console.ipynb**` displays a successful message

** If an error occurs, the error description is displayed in the `**delete_application_on_console.ipynb**` and running is interrupted.

*** See https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/guides/["**Cloud SDK Console Access Library (Python) Functional Specifications**"] for details on errors and response times



== Target performances/Impact on performances
** Usability

*** When the SDK environment is built, AI models and "**PPL**" can be imported into "**Console for AITRIOS**" without any additional installation steps

** UI response time of 1.2 seconds or less
** If processing takes more than 5 seconds, indicates that processing is in progress with successive updates

== Assumption/Restriction
* If you cancel and restart an encoding or import process, start each process from the beginning instead of resuming in the middle

== Remarks
* None

== Unconfirmed items
* None
