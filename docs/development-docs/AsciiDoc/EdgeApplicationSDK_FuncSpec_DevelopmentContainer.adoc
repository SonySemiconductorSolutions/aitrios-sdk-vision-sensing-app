* Use an environment that doesn't depend on other environments
* Teams use the same environment
* Understand an overview of the entire workflow for AI application development by trying it out with sample code
* Develop smoothly even without knowledge of AI application development

== Functional overview/Algorithm
=== Functional overview
* Provides a container environment for developing AI applications +
** The container environment can be used in the following ways:
*** Using Codespaces
**** There are two types of UI: Browser and VS Code desktop

*** Build a container environment on your Local PC and use it from VS Code

** The container environment includes:
*** Tools and operating environments available for each AI application development workflow
*** Procedure in each workflow
*** Sample code
**** See the following <<workflow,_AI application development workflows and features to provide_>> for details +

NOTE: Specific details of each function contained in a container are described in the functional specifications of each function, not in this document.

* Users can get information needed to develop AI applications
** Users can view documentation for each workflow in AI application development
** Users can view functional specifications

=== Others Exclusive conditions / specifications
* No Docker images are included
* No build environment for firmware of edge AI devices is included
* Provides reference links for the sample "**Cloud App**"

== User interface specifications
=== Prerequisite
* If you want to use Codespaces, be prepared to use it
** If you want to use Codespaces (VS Code desktop), install <<codespaces-extension,_VS Code Codespaces extension_>>
* If you want to use VS Code on your Local PC, intall <<remote-development,_VS Code Remote Development Extension Pack_>>

=== Start container
Start the development environment by the following procedure.

* Codespaces (Browser)
. Press the [**Create codespace on <branch name>**] from the [**Codespaces**] tab of the [**Code**] in the SDK repository
* Codespaces (VS Code desktop)
. Press the [**Create codespace on <branch name>**] from the [**Codespaces**] tab of the [**Code**] in the SDK repository
. After creating Codespace, press the [**Codespaces**] in the bottom left of the Codespace browser
. Select the [**Open with VS Code**] from the drop-down list
* Local PC
. Access the SDK repository from GitHub, clone the SDK repository to your environment, and open it in VS Code
. Press the [**><**] mark at the bottom left of VS Code, or press the "Ctrl + Shift + P" to open the command palette and click the [**Reopen in Container**]

[NOTE]
====
To interrupt the container during startup, follow the procedure:

* Codespaces (Browser)
** Press the [**×**] button in your browser
* Codespaces (VS Code desktop) or using VS Code on a Local PC
** Press the VS Code's [**×**] button
====

[NOTE]
====
To check container startup progress, follow the procedure:

* Codespaces (Browser)
** Press the [**View logs**] when it appears in the Codespaces browser +
* Codespaces (VS Code desktop) or using VS Code on a Local PC
** Press the [**Starting Dev Container (show log) **] from notification in bottom right of VS Code screen
====

=== Get information needed to develop AI applications
The following documents are available:

* Procedure for each workflow of AI application development (README)
. Jump from the link in the repository top `**README.md**` to the `**README.md**` in the `**tutorials**` directory of the <<directory-structure, _Directory structure for the container_>>
.  Jump from the link in the `**README.md**` in the `**tutorials**` directory to the `**README.md**` under each feature directory such as `**1_initialize**`
* Functional specifications
. Jump from the link in the repository top `**README.md**` to the functional specifications

== Target performances/Impact on performances
* Usability
** When the SDK environment is built, the container is available for developing AI applications without any additional installation steps
** Users must be able to navigate the container environment with the VS Code UI

== Assumption/Restriction
* Features provided by the SDK may not work properly depending on the specs of Codespaces or Local PC
** For Codespaces, a Machine Type of 4-core or higher is recommended

== Remarks
* No error codes and messages are defined in the SDK
* Does not specify the UI response time on container startup, as it is affected by the user's network environment for Codespaces and the user's Docker operating environment for Local PC
** However, both Codespaces and Local PC have a proven UI response within 10 seconds on startup
*** Performance was measured under the following conditions:
**** Codespaces: Select Machine Type 4-core
**** Local PC: Start on a machine with the following specs:
