----


. Get connection information
** Get credentials needed to connect to AITRIOS

. Create and edit the configuration file
** Create the configuration file and set the information gotten in 1

. Run the notebook
** Run the notebook to authenticate to AITRIOS

* See next chapter for details on each flow

== User interface specifications
=== Prerequisite
* You have registered as a user through "**Portal for AITRIOS**" and participated in the AITRIOS project

=== How to start each function
. Jump to the `**README.md**` in the `**set_up_console_client**` directory from the hyperlink in the `**README.md**` in the directory for each feature that uses the "**Console Access Library**"

=== Get connection information
Get the following information to connect to "**Console for AITRIOS**" using the API: + 
This information is used in <<anchor-edit, _Create and edit the configuration file_>> of the next section.

* Server URL + 
Check the following from the documentation of this function (`**README.md**`) :
** API server base URL
** Authentication server URL

* Client app details + 
Get from the list of client apps in "**Portal for AITRIOS**": + 
See https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/documents/portal-user-manual/["**Portal User Manual**"] for details.

** Client ID
** Secret

[[anchor-edit]]
=== Create and edit the configuration file
Create the <<anchor-conf, _configuration file_>> in the `**set_up_console_client**` directory, and set the preceding connection information.

NOTE: All parameters are required.

NOTE: The parameters passed to the "**Console Access Library**" API are as specified in the <<anchor-ref, _"**Console Access Library**" API_>>.

|===

=== Run the notebook
. Open the notebook, _*.ipynb_, in the directory for client authentication under the `**common**` directory, and run the python scripts in it
** The scripts do the following:
*** Checks that <<anchor-conf, _configuration file_>> exists in the execution directory
**** If an error occurs, the error description is displayed and running is interrupted.
*** Checks that <<anchor-conf, _configuration file_>> includes each parameter
**** If an error occurs, the error description is displayed and running is interrupted.
*** Reads the value of each parameter from <<anchor-conf, _configuration file_>> to call API for system client authentication
**** If an error occurs, the error description is displayed and running is interrupted.
**** If authentication succeeds and the client instance is created successfully, displays a successful message
*** Saves the client instance for use by other notebooks in the SDK
** See https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/guides/["**Console Access Library**" Functional Specifications] for details on errors and response times
