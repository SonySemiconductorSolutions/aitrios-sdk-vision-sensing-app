== Reference materials

* Reference/Related documents
** API Reference
*** https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/guides/

== Expected use case

* To give you an overview of the SDK in a day, let you run a series of SDK workflows in the single notebook, using the example of the sample application "**Zone Detection**" + 
However, parts you can't run on Codespaces provide documentation instead

== Functional overview/Algorithm

=== Functional overview

* In the following flow, using the sample application "**Zone Detection**" as an example, the features provided by the SDK can be performed in the single notebook

* It is recommended to run the cell of the notebook one by one

* Indicates approximate time for notebook cells that take longer

* SDK includes backup data of CVAT project annotating images taken with an edge AI device as a sample of "**Zone Detection**"

* SDK includes a TFRecord format dataset annotated with images taken with an edge AI device as a sample of "**Zone Detection**"

* In the SDK, include the Output Tensor information inferenced in the quantized AI model for which transfer learning is done with the "**Zone Detection**" sample

* Users can build the "**Edge Application**", edit PPL parameter information, use Output Tensor information to debug the "**Edge Application**" and output serialized inference result metadata

* Users can deserialize serialized inference result metadata and display images overlaid with inference results

* By importing the "**Edge Application**" into "**Console for AITRIOS**", the AI model and "**Edge Application**" can be deployed in the Edge AI device

NOTE: The AI model to be deployed in the Edge AI device can be created using the "**Console UI**"

* The image format supported by the SDK is JPEG

* Flow overview
