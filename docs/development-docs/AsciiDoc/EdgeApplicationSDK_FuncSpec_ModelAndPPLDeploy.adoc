== Change history

|===
|Date |What/Why

|2023/01/30
|Initial draft.

|2023/05/26
|Fixed the notation of tool names and parentheses. + 
Some environments do not render AsciiDoc's Mermaid diagrams, so modified to rendered image references. + 
Added alternate text to images.
|===

== Terms/Abbreviations
|===
|Terms/Abbreviations |Meaning 

|Deployment configuration
|Used to deploy AI models. + 
 Specify the AI model to deploy, etc. and register it in "**Console for AITRIOS**". + 
Run a deployment by specifying a registered deployment configuration. + 
Note that it is separate from the `**configuration.json**` to configure notebook runtime settings.

|"**PPL**"
|A module that processes the output of the AI model (Output Tensor) of edge AI devices

** "**Console User Manual**"
*** https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/documents/console-user-manual/


== Expected use case

* Deploy an AI model imported into "**Console for AITRIOS**" to edge AI devices

* Deploy a "**PPL**" imported into "**Console for AITRIOS**" to edge AI devices

* Check AI model or "**PPL**" deployment state

== Functional overview/Algorithm

=== Functional overview

* Users can use "**Console Access Library**" in the SDK's Dev Container (Local PC or Codespaces)

** Users can do the following through the "**Console Access Library**":

*** Get device information for deployment
*** Register a new deployment configuration to deploy AI model
*** Get a list of registered deployment configurations
*** Delete a registered deployment configuration
*** Deploy an AI model to edge AI devices
*** Deploy a "**PPL**" to edge AI devices

[NOTE]
====
To run inference after deploying an AI model, + 
set the model ID using command parameter of the "**Console for AITRIOS**". + 
These are beyond the scope of this book. + 
See <<anchor-ref, _"**Console User Manual**"_>> for details.

==== Cancel AI model deployment state

* Flow

[NOTE]
====
"Cancel AI model deployment state" is to reset state on the database. + 
Use when a edge AI device stops responding after deploying AI model, leaving deployment state "running" on database. + 
You can't rerun deployment in this state and must cancel. + 
(Do not rerun the notebook to deploy AI model in this state.) + 
You can't cancel deployment to edge AI devices. + 
You can't recover that edge AI device stops responding by SDK. + 
Restart or reset by other means.

** The scripts do the following:

*** Checks that <<anchor-conf-del, _configuration.json_>> exists in the `**delete_deploy_config**` directory

**** If an error occurs, the error description is displayed and running is interrupted.

*** Checks the contents of <<anchor-conf-del, _configuration.json_>>

**** If an error occurs, the error description is displayed and running is interrupted.

*** Runs the API to delete deployment configuration

**** If deletion is successful, `**delete_deploy_config.ipynb**` displays a successful message

** If an error occurs, the error description is displayed in the `**delete_deploy_config.ipynb**` and running is interrupted.

== Target performances/Impact on performances
* Usability

** When the SDK environment is built, AI models and "**PPL**" can be deployed from "**Console for AITRIOS**" to edge AI devices without any additional installation steps

** UI response time of 1.2 seconds or less
** If processing takes more than 5 seconds, indicates that processing is in progress with successive updates
** Provides users with documentation of usage tools and version information

== Assumption/Restriction
* You can't cancel deployment or deletion of deployment configuration halfway
* If you cancel and restart notebooks, start each process from the beginning instead of resuming in the middle

== Remarks
* None

== Unconfirmed items
* None
