## Overview
"**Edge Application SDK**" for AITRIOS is a toolkit for developing AI models and post-processing applications that can be installed on Edge AI Devices. Post-processing applications are called "**Edge Applications**".
The models and "**Edge Applications**" can be deployed to Edge AI Devices through "**Console for AITRIOS**".

![overview](./Images_README/overview.png)

### What you can do with the "**Edge Application SDK**"
- Use GitHub Codespaces (Dev Container) as development environment.
  - You don't need to install any additional tools in your environment.
<br>

- Develop your AI models in the container.
<br>

- Develop "**Edge Applications**" using build environment and sample code included in the container.
<br>

- Import AI models and "**Edge Applications**" to "**Console for AITRIOS**" and deploy them to Edge AI Devices.

### Components
"**Edge Application SDK**" is provided as Development Container (Dev Container) that runs on GitHub Codespaces or Docker environment on Local PC.
This container includes tools and jupyter notebooks that can be used for development.

### Restrictions

#### About "**Edge Application SDK**"

- AI model training
    - Datasets for Object Detection created on the Dev Container cannot be used for training base AI models (only for training user's custom AI models).
<br>

- AI model quantization on Dev Container
    - Supported AI models are based on ["**Model Compression Toolkit (MCT)**"'s features](https://github.com/sony/model_optimization/tree/v1.8.0#supported-features).
<br>

- Jupyter specification
    - Variables in jupyter notebook are cleared when GitHub Codespaces stop.

#### About AITRIOS

- Evaluation of output results
    - Images and inference results output from devices cannot be downloaded from "**Console for AITRIOS**".
    - Inference results displayed on "**Console for AITRIOS**" are serialized. 
    - To deserialize inference results, see [README for deserializing](./tutorials/_common/deserialize/README.md).
    
<br>

- Device operation
    - Edge AI Devices can only be operated through "**Console for AITRIOS**".
<br>

#### About GitHub Codespaces

- Codespaces specification
    - It takes about 15 minutes to start a container on Codespaces for the first time. From the second time onwards, it starts up within 1 minute.
    - By default, a container on Codespaces continues running for 30 minutes without any operation. You can change the settings for up to 4 hours.

## Installation Guide

See [Development Environment Setup Guide](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/documents/sdk-getting-started/).
<br>

>**NOTE**
>
> - 4-core (8GB) or higher machine types are recommended when using the SDK on Codespaces.
>     - If 2-core is selected, an error may occur during Dev Container build.
> - To ensure security of connection for CVAT, do NOT make [Codespace's port forwarding sharing option](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace) "Public".
> - If Jupyter Kernels picker displayed when you try to run Jupyter notebook first time, please select "Python Environment" and select "Python 3.8".

## Samples
You can learn the development workflow using the samples in a day. <br>
See ["**Edge Application SDK**" samples](./samples/README.md).

## Tutorials
You can start the development workflow using the tutorial. <br>
See ["**Edge Application SDK**" tutorials](./tutorials/README.md).

>**NOTE**
>
> If you are unfamiliar with "**Edge Application SDK**", it's recommended to learn with [Samples](#samples) first.

## Migration Guide

### From SDK v0.2 to v1.0

If you have already developed the "**Edge Application**" using SDK v0.2,
you need to modify the "**Edge Application**" source code to migrate to SDK v1.0.

See ["**Edge Application**" Migration Guide from SDK v0.2 to v1.0](./tutorials/4_prepare_application/1_develop/README_migration_0.2_1.0.md).
